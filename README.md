# Day 2 Find Kth Row
<p> Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
Given a square binary matrix ‘mat[n][n]’, find ‘K’ such that all elements in the Kth row are ‘0’ and all elements in the Kth column are ‘1’. The value of mat[k][k] can be anything (either ‘0’ or ‘1’). If no such k exists, return ‘-1’.
For Example
Consider the following matrix :
{ 0 1 1 
, 0 1 0 
, 1 1 0 }

You can see that row 1 (0-based) contains all 0’s except mat[1][1] and column 1 contains all 1’s. Hence the answer for the above case is 1.
