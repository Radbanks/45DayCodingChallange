45 Day Coding Challenge by Coding Ninjas

# Challanges List
- [Day of the Week](#day-1-day-of-the-week) 
- [Find Kth Row](#day-2-find-kth-row)
- [Power of Power](#day-3-power-of-power)
- [Closest Distance Pair](#day-4-closest-distance-pair)

# Day 1 Day of the Week
<p> Write a function that calculates the corresponding day of the week for any particular date in the past or future.
For example, for the date 28th August 2020 happens to be Friday. Hence the expected output will be Friday.

# Day 2 Find Kth Row
<p> Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
Given a square binary matrix ‘mat[n][n]’, find ‘K’ such that all elements in the Kth row are ‘0’ and all elements in the Kth column are ‘1’. The value of mat[k][k] can be anything (either ‘0’ or ‘1’). If no such k exists, return ‘-1’.
For Example
Consider the following matrix :
{ 0 1 1 
, 0 1 0 
, 1 1 0 }

You can see that row 1 (0-based) contains all 0’s except mat[1][1] and column 1 contains all 1’s. Hence the answer for the above case is 1.

# Day 3 Power of power
<p> Problem statement
  Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
Hisoka was so hungry for power that he left Phantom Troupe in search of power. He met two kids on his way, Gon and Killua. They gave him four numbers A, B, C, and M where M is a Prime Number and told him that if he can calculate A ^ (B ^ C) Mod M, he will gain a lot of powers. Hisoka is weak in coding. Can you help hisoka solve this problem of powers.
For Example :
A = 2, B = 2, C = 3, M = 5

Computing B ^ C gives 2 ^ 3 = 8, Now A ^ (B ^ C) = 2 ^ 8 = 256.  256 Mod 5 is 1. Hence the final answer is 1.

# Day 4 Closest Distance Pair
<p> Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given an array containing 'N' points in the plane. The task is to find out the distance of the closest points.
Note :
Where distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as [(x1 - x2) ^ 2] + [(y1 - y2) ^ 2].
